- 👋 Heya, I’m Codealize!
- 🌟I'm currently learning HTML and CSS and Luau.
- 💻 I also code in ROBLOX and Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
- 📋 I'll be uploading many of my various projects here, plus leave your feedback here, so I know how to improve my projects for you all! :)
- 🧑‍💻 I'm also learning about iOS downgrading.
- 🍎 I have a big interest in Apple's iPhones and iPods.
- 🤖 Everyone's opinions should be respected, no hate to Android or Google! Since I've been using Apple for 10 years or so, I still think Android is pretty cool with their customization! Big ups to Google AND Apple for doing a good job on their products!
