- 👋 Heya I'm the Unknown Dev! (he/him)
- 🌟I'm currently learning HTML and CSS and Luau.
- 💻 I also code in ROBLOX and Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
- 📋 I'll be uploading many of my various projects here, plus leave your feedback here, so I know how to improve my projects for you all! :)
- 🧑‍💻 I'm also learning about iOS downgrading.
- 🍎 I have a big interest in Apple's iPhones and iPods.
- 🤖 Everyone's opinions should be respected, no hate to Android or Google! Since I've been using Apple for 10 years or so, I still think Android is pretty cool with their customization! Big ups to Google AND Apple for doing a good job on their products!
- 💻 & 🖥 I really like using computers and laptops, they are really fun to use and spark my creativity. I've also used a Mac before, but I've been using Windows for about 10 years. Never owned a Mac, but I've used them before!!! ;)

Original desc on my profile: I code in ROBLOX, and Microsoft Visual Studio Code in my free time, I'll be uploading my projects here!
I’m also learning more about Apple devices too.
